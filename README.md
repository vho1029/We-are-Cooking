## Problem Statement
The **We-are-Cooking** project is a **meal preparation and recipe application** designed to streamline the cooking process. Eating out daily or hiring a private chef is expensive, and individuals who work long hours often lack the time or energy to cook meals at home. This project aims to provide **cost-effective solutions** for individuals on a **low budget** or those who lack the time to prepare every meal. Our goal is to help users **make health-conscious decisions, save time, and simplify meal preparation.

Competitors include **Hello Fresh, Blue Apron, Factor,** and **New York Times Cooking**. However, these services require **subscriptions**, with Hello Fresh, Blue Apron, and Factor often being more expensive than purchasing ingredients independently. Our approach is unique as we will provide the **current pricing of ingredients** and **total costs for recipes**, offering a **budget-friendly solution**.
